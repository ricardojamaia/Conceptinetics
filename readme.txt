This library has been developed to support the CTC-DRA-13-1 Isolated DMX-RDM Shield ans CTC-DRA-10-1 No Isolated Shield on the Arduino platform. 
That being said does not mean that the library won't work with other interfaces. This library works on the principle of using a RS485 driver to drive a DMX line or act as a receiver ( DMX Slave )

If you wish to make additions or find bugs or would like to contribute in any other way then please don't hesitate to contact me via my email address: danny@illogic.nl or use report issues on the sourceforge project page instead.
